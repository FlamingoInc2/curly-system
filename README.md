## Overview
### Description
Our app will allow users to view and recieve notifications of stocks. Users will be able to decide what stocks they would like to be alerted when it begins to rise and fall.  

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Financial 
- **Mobile:** Using Realtime Data, Push notifications.
- **Story:** Allows users to access stock prices and view price history. Also allows for price alerts.
- **Market:** Anyone who is interested with stocks or has invested in stocks. The ability to add alerts could grab others.
- **Habit:** Could be habit forming if the user is invested. As they would want to know how certain stocks are trending leading to viewing multiple times.
- **Scope:** The product can be striped down to just a list of stocks and their current price. Though the goal is to expand that to graphs of price history and push notifications for the user. Push notifications could be challanging.
